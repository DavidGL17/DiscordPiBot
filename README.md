# DiscordPiBot

A discord bot i use to warn me about different things. It currently warns me about :

-   new raspberry pis availability using the rpilocator.com rss feed

# Installation

-   First install all requirements with pip
-   Then set the token.txt file with your personal bot token and the correct rss feed url in the main.py file
-   Launch the program!

# Improvements being made :

-   I need to make a nice messaging format for when there are new pis available
-   ideally all settings could be in a single file (json or yaml)
